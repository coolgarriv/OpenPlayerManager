We remake the football (soccer) managerial game created for Commodore Amiga And Atari ST on 1990

An International class football player takes charge of a third division club as Player Maanger. His brief is simple - Bring Back The Glory Days.
His success depends on his playing skills on the pitch and managerial skills in devising winning tactics, aquiring the right players from the transfer market and building a team worthy of the highest honours.

The game is partially open source, The Player Manager 2015 is an hybrid game inspired by Kick Off 2 (gfx, game logic), Player Manager, and other football manager games.
The Player Manager 2015 source code is 100% original work made collectively by the Kick Off World community www.kickoffworld.net

The Open Player Manager files are: translations, manuals, football player surnames, football teams, tournaments, field graphics (pitches) and football player graphics. Every fan are welcome to translate, redesign, improve it and share it with all the Kick Off World community.

The mix between management and arcade is the best to have appeared in any football game, making it enthralling and addictive. There is a whole mess of extra options and choices that, added together, make this an unique Managerial Game. If you did own Kick Off and Player Manager already this is a must have game. If you did not own Kick Off or Player Manager you miss the most revolutionary soccer games ever created, this should be near the be the most fast paced football game ever developed and with the most accurate ball control and phisycs.

But where PM really holds it own is on the management side. Here, in amongst all the detailed form sheets and generous assortment of menus, is where all the important decisions are made, starting right off with who you are. There are basically two roles you can play. The first, and possibly the easiest, is the true managerial role, in which case you can play the whole team, as in Kick Off. The oter role, is the role of a true player manager, where you still make all the managerial choices, but can only play football as one member of the team. In this mode, you can only play your chosen position, and have to work with the computer operating the rest of your team for you. Tough to play, but infinitely more rewarding.
A lot of the menus and options cover old ground, but in the case of player transfer markets and financial details, that is unavoidable. However, possibly one of the most impressive options yet seen on a managerial game, and the keystone to addictiveness and involvement of this game, is the Tactics option. Forget selecting 4-24 or 4-3-3, PM lets you plan all your set pieces just the way you want them. An infinite amount of different strategies are available for you, the only limit is your imagination. By placing the players in the best positions for your style of play, and marking out approximate ‘trace’ lines, telling each player where they should be for any given moment, you will never be able to say that you are not in full control of your game.
